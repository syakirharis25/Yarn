## 1. Introduction.
<img src="yarn.jpg" height="150"> 
Yarn is a JavaScript Package Manager, a direct competitor of npm, and it’s one of the Facebook Open Source projects. It is compatible with npm packages, so it has the great advantage of being a drop-in replacement for npm.
<br /><br />
Yarn is a new package manager that replaces the existing workflow for the npm client or other package managers while remaining compatible with the npm registry. It has the same feature set as existing workflows while operating faster, more securely, and more reliably.
<br /><br />
The primary function of any package manager is to install some package — a piece of code that serves a particular purpose — from a global registry into an engineer's local environment. Each package may or may not depend on other packages. A typical project could have tens, hundreds, or even thousands of packages within its tree of dependencies.
<br /><br />
These dependencies are versioned and installed based on semantic versioning (semver). Semver defines a versioning scheme that reflects the types of changes in each new version, whether a change breaks an API, adds a new feature, or fixes a bug. However, semver relies on package developers not making mistakes — breaking changes or new bugs may find their way into installed dependencies if the dependencies are not locked down.
